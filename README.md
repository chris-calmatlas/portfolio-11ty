# How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML/CSS, Javascript, 11ty (Jamstack), nunjucks

# Optimization
Scripts and css are currently being passed through instead of being minified. Since there's minification for .js and .css built into 11ty I'd like to implement that.

# Todo
- [ ] Analytics
- [ ] Actually put the projects in their places
