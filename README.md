# How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML/CSS, Javascript, 11ty (Jamstack), nunjucks

# Optimization
Scripts and css from the original template are mostly being passed through instead of being processed by 11ty. Since there's minification for .js and .css built into 11ty I'd like to get that set up correctly.

# Todo
- [x] Analytics
- [ ] Actually put the projects in their places
