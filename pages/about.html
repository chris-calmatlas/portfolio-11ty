    <p>I love technology. I've been around it for a long time and the most important thing I've learned is that it changes constantly. The newest frameworks, latest standards, hot technologies... I've been a System Administrator in some capacity for the last 10 years, some sytems more modern than others. I made my first program in 2004 and I've dabbled ever since.</p>
    <p>I'm a fullstack web developer leveraging Javascript with Node.js as a backend. In addition to the obvious web technologies like CSS and HTML, I have experience with common js libraries like jquery and react and frameworks like bootstrap and I've used some Jamstacks like 11ty. I'm always open to learning more efficient ways of building. I've also built and hosted Wordpress and Drupal sites, so I have experience with PHP and SQL and I've spooled up plenty of Apache servers generally as part of a LAMP stack using MariaDB/MySQL</p>
    <p>If you have a great idea for a Web Application or even if you've already gotten started and need to hash out some details and work out some kinks. I'm here to listen and get your product to launch.</p>
    <p>I'm your next Software Engineer. Let's build something.</p>
