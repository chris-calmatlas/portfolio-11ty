    <blockquote>
        A physicist, a mathematician, and an engineer were asked to determine the volume of a red rubber ball.
        The physicist filled a beaker with water, immersed the ball, caught the runoff and measured its volume.      
        The mathematician set up and solved an appropriate triple integral, then measured the diameter of the ball and plugged in the number.        
        The engineer looked around on his bookshelf, then asked,        
        "Has anyone got a red rubber ball volume table? I've only got the ones for blue and purple."

    <p>I love this joke because it's poking fun at engineers. The truth is, we solve practical problems by standing on the shoulders of giants. I love technology. I've been around it for a long time and the most important thing I've learned is that it changes constantly. Read the manual, ask questions, and accept what you knew yesterday might be completely wrong today.</p>

    <p> The newest frameworks, latest standards, hot technologies... I've been a System Administrator in some capacity for at least the last 10 years, some systems more modern than others. I made my first program in 2004 and I've dabbled ever since while focusing on the infrastructure that make things work. Today, I'm a freelance fullstack web developer leveraging Javascript with Node.js as a backend while I support local government IT infrastucture as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
    <p>In addition to the obvious web techologies like CSS and HTML, I have experience with common js libraries like jquery and react and frameworks like bootstrap, plus I've used some Jamstacks like 11ty and Gatsby. I'm always open to learning more efficient ways of building. I've also setup and hosted Wordpress and Drupal sites, so I have experience with PHP and SQL and I've spooled up plenty of Apache servers generally as part of a LAMP stack using MariaDB/MySQL. There's always more documentation, there's always something to learn, and there are always problems to solve.</p>
    <p>If you have a great idea for a Web Application or even if you've already gotten started and need to hash out some details and work out some kinks. I'm here to listen and get your product to launch.</p>
    <p>I'm your next Software Engineer. Let's build something.</p>
